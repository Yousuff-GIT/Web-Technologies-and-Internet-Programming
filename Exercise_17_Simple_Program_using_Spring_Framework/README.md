# EXNO: 3A (iii) â€“ Simple Program using Spring Framework

## AIM
To implement a simple program using Spring framework.

## PROCEDURE
1. Create a dynamic web project with Spring library (JAR files).
2. Create a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) class with getters and setters.
3. Create another Plain Old Java Object (POJO) class with objects of previous POJO class and generate getters and setters.
4. Create an implementation class with Application Context object.
5. Invoke `getBean()` method with bean id parameter using Application Context object.
6. Create a `spring.xml` file with `bean` and `property` tags which links all the POJO class objects and provides values for member variables.
7. Run the implementation java class.

## TECHNOLOGY USED
- Java
- Spring Framework
- XML

## RESULT
Thus a simple program using spring framework was implemented and verified.
