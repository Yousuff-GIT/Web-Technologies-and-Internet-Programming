# Exercise 2D - Online Examination using Servlets

## Aim
To write a Java program to create a three-tier application using Servlets for conducting online examinations and displaying student mark lists.

## Procedure
1. Create a Database in MySQL server and populate the table with Students information.
2. Design a JSP page for student authentication (`Login.jsp`).
3. Create a Servlet (`ServletOne.java`) for validating student authorization.
4. Design a JSP page (`Exam.jsp`) to conduct the online examination for authorized students.
5. Create a Servlet (`ServletTwo.java`) for evaluating the exam and updating the database.
6. Display the student mark list via servlet response.
7. Handle login failures (`Invalid.jsp`) and exam reattempt (`Over.jsp`) with respective pages.
8. Use `web.xml` for servlet mapping and deployment.
9. Add output screenshots in the Screenshots folder and the required image under the Images folder.

## Output
The expected output is visible through the screenshots stored under `/Screenshots/`.

- Login Interface
- Exam Form
- Mark Sheet Summary

## Result
Thus, a Java servlet-based online examination system was successfully created and verified.
