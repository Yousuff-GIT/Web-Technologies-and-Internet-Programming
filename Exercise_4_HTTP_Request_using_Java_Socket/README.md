# Exercise 2A (i) – HTTP Request Using Java Socket

## Aim
To demonstrate how to perform an HTTP request using Java socket programming.

## Procedure
1. Create a basic HTML page and deploy it under a Tomcat web application folder (e.g., `HTTPRequestDemo`).
2. Start the Apache Tomcat server and confirm the HTML page loads via browser.
3. Write a Java program using `Socket` and `InetAddress` to connect to the server at port 8080.
4. Use `PrintWriter` to send a raw HTTP GET request manually.
5. Use `BufferedReader` to read the server’s response (status headers and HTML content).
6. Compile and run the Java program to verify the HTTP response.

## Output
The HTTP headers and the HTML content of the web page are displayed in the console.

## Result
Thus, the HTTP request was successfully demonstrated using Java socket programming and the server's response was verified.
