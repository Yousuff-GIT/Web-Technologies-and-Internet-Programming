# Exercise 2A (ii) – FTP Using Java Socket

## Aim
To demonstrate the working of a basic File Transfer Protocol (FTP) mechanism using Java Socket Programming.

## Procedure
1. Develop `FTPServer.java` to accept multiple connections on port 4444 using multithreading.
2. Implement `ClientConnection.java` to handle individual client file send/receive logic on the server.
3. Develop `FTPClient.java` to allow the user to either send a file or request a file from the server.
4. Establish socket connections between the server and the client.
5. Use appropriate streams for reading and writing file data during transfer.
6. Compile and run all Java files in the appropriate order and observe terminal logs.

## Output
Refer to the screenshots in the `Output/` folder:
1. **01_ServerSide_Output.png** – Demonstrates server response when a file is sent and received.
2. **02_ClientSide_Output.png** – Shows client interaction for sending and receiving a file.

## Result
The file transfer protocol (FTP) operations were successfully demonstrated using Java socket programming.
