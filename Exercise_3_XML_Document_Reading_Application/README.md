# EXNO: 1C - XML Document Reading Application

## Date
_(To be filled by student/teacher during evaluation)_

## Aim
To develop a Java-based web application using JSP to read user information from an XML document hosted on a server.

## Procedure
1. **Design XML Schema (XSD):** Define the structure for storing 10 users' data fields using XML Schema.
2. **Create XML Document:** Generate an XML file conforming to the schema with dummy data for 10 users.
3. **Form Input Page (JSP):** Build a JSP form to accept a student's roll number.
4. **Processing Page (JSP):** Use DOM parser in JSP to process the input roll number and extract relevant data from the XML.
5. **Output Display:** Render the student's complete profile in a structured HTML table using JSP logic.
6. **Execution:** Host the application using Apache Tomcat and access it through a web browser.

## Output
When a user enters a valid roll number, the corresponding student details are displayed. If the roll number is not found, an error message is shown.

## Result
Thus, a Java web application was developed using JSP to read an XML document and render user data dynamically based on input, and the output was verified successfully.
