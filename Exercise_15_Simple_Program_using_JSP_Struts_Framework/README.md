# EXNO:3A (i) - SIMPLE PROGRAM USING JSP STRUTS FRAMEWORK

## AIM
To implement a simple program using JSP Struts framework.

## PROCEDURE
1. Create a dynamic web project with Struts library (JAR files).
2. Design a form using Struts Tag Library.
3. Create a `web.xml` file with a filter tag that forwards all the requests to `struts.xml`.
4. Create a `struts.xml` file with an action tag that links the Java action class outcome with the relevant JSP page.
5. Create a POJO class with setters, getters, and an `execute()` method which invokes the business logic class.
6. Create the business logic Java class which performs the required processing and returns the result to the POJO class.
7. Run the Struts application on a web server.

## RESULT
Thus a simple program using JSP Struts framework was implemented and verified.
