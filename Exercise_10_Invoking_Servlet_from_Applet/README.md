# Exercise 2C (ii): Invoking Servlet from Applet

**Date:**  
**Aim:**  
To write a servlet and applet program using Java and to invoke the servlet from applet.

---

## Procedure

1. Create an applet class which extends `Applet`.
2. Define methods such as `init()` and `paint()` within the applet class.
3. Define the input and output stream in the applet to send the data.
4. Create a servlet class which extends `HttpServlet`.
5. Define variables and implement the `service()` method to handle HTTP requests.
6. Use input and output streams in the servlet to receive and respond to data.
7. Mention the servlet's path using a `URL` object in the applet.
8. Configure servlet mappings inside the `web.xml` deployment descriptor.
9. Run the applet file.

---

## Result

Thus the servlet was invoked from the applet and the output was verified successfully.
