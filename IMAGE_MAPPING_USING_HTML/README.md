# Exercise 1A â€“ Image Mapping Using HTML

## Aim
The objective of this exercise is to create an interactive webpage using HTML by embedding an image and incorporating image mapping techniques. The webpage must enable users to click on specific regions of the image (hotspots) to view related information about different web browsers.

## Procedure
1. Construct a basic HTML file that includes all essential tags.
2. Insert the target image using the `<img>` tag, referencing the image path in the `src` attribute.
3. Define clickable areas (hotspots) within the image using the `<area>` tag, specifying the shape and coordinate points using the `shape` and `coords` attributes respectively.
4. Develop individual HTML files containing detailed information related to each hotspot.
5. Link each hotspot to its corresponding HTML file using the `href` attribute within the `<area>` tag.
6. Open the primary HTML file in a web browser.
7. Navigate and interact with the hotspots to ensure they display the correct linked information when clicked.

## Result
The implementation of image mapping using HTML was completed successfully. The webpage enables users to interact with designated regions of the embedded image and view relevant browser-specific details, thereby fulfilling the aim of this exercise.
