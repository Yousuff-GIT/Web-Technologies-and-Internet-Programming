# EXNO:3D - Web Service for Product Sales Prediction

## Aim
To write a web service for predicting any product sales based on historical data.

## Procedure
1. Create a database and table to hold product sales data.
2. Populate the table with the sales percentages for the last five years.
3. Write a Web Service Provider in Java using JAX-WS annotations.
4. Deploy and test the service using NetBeans.
5. Create a client-side JSP interface to interact with the user.
6. Use the generated WSDL to create proxy classes.
7. Send the product name to the web service and receive the predicted sales percentage.
8. Display the predicted sales result on the client side.

## Files Included
- `PredictionWebService.java`: Java web service logic.
- `Product.jsp`: JSP form for product selection.
- `Sales.jsp`: JSP page that calls the web service and shows prediction.
- `output/`: Contains screenshots of the web service test and interface.

## Result
Thus, a web service for predicting product sales was successfully developed, deployed, and tested.
