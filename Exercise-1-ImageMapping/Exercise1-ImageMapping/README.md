# EXNO: 1A - Image Mapping Using HTML

## Aim
To develop a webpage using HTML that incorporates image mapping techniques by:
1. Embedding a map in the webpage.
2. Defining interactive hotspots within the map.
3. Displaying relevant information when hotspots are clicked.

## Procedure
1. Create an HTML file using standard structure and tags.
2. Include the image using the `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute.
3. Define clickable areas (hotspots) using the `<area>` tag with `shape` and `coords` attributes.
4. Create individual HTML pages containing information for each hotspot.
5. Link each hotspot to its respective HTML page using the `href` attribute.
6. Save all files and open the main HTML page in a browser.
7. Interact with the image to test the functionality of each hotspot.

## Result
The image mapping concept was successfully implemented using HTML, and the interactive output was verified in the browser.
