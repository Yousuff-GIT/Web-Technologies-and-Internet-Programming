# EXNO:3B (ii) - Instant Login Feedback and Auto Complete Using AJAX

## Aim
To implement instant login feedback and answer with auto complete using AJAX.

## Procedure
1. Design a form to get user details and location using JSP.
2. Create an AJAX object using XMLHttpRequest method and relate that object with an event inside a JSP page.
3. Create a Database and table to store user information.
4. Invoke the AJAX object to call a JSP page when the user enters the username completely.
5. Verify the database and provide an instant feedback regarding username availability.
6. Create an XML Schema (XSD) and generate the XML file to store the list of cities.
7. Invoke the AJAX object to call a JSP page when the user starts entering the city name.
8. Extract all the city names which match with the user's input.
9. Collect and return matching city names using AJAX.
10. Display the cities below the city text field using AJAX `responseText`.
11. Save the completed form details into the database.
12. Run the application on a web server.
