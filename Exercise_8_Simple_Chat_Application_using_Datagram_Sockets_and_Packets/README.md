# Exercise 2B â€“ Simple Chat Application Using Datagram Sockets and Packets

## Aim
To write a Java program that facilitates a simple chat application using Datagram sockets and Datagram packets.

## Procedure
1. Develop a Java class for the server using DatagramSocket, DatagramPacket, BufferedReader, and InetAddress.
2. Assign appropriate port numbers to both server and client for two-way communication.
3. Develop a Java client program using similar constructs.
4. Continuously send and receive messages between server and client using datagram packets.
5. Terminate the session gracefully when the STOP command is issued.

## Output
The output is a two-way chat communication displayed via two command prompt windows showing real-time message exchange.

## Result
Thus, the Java program for a chat application using datagram sockets and packets was successfully implemented and verified.
